  content: `I am a Computer Science graduate from the International Hellenic University, Alexandria Campus, with a strong foundation in programming, machine learning, and software development. My technical expertise spans a range of tools and languages, including Java, Python, Flutter, Kotlin, React, and more.

My recent work includes developing an AI-powered podcast categorization tool, where I utilized advanced machine learning models like YAMNet, DeepFilterNet, Whisper, and BART to enhance podcast discoverability, improve content indexing, and enable real-time user interaction.

With a solid understanding of data structures, security, and machine learning, I am always eager to learn from experienced professionals and contribute to creating cutting-edge solutions. Let's connect and explore how we can build the future of tech together!`
